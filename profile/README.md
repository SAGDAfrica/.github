# SAGDA - Synthetic Agriculture Data in Africa
SAGDA is an open-source initiative focused on creating and providing synthetic agricultural datasets for Africa’s agricultural sector. Our mission is to support research, innovation, and sustainable practices through data generation, augmentation, and validation, helping drive informed decisions for Africa’s agricultural future.

## Key Features  
The SAGDA Python library provides:
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Tools to generate synthetic datasets for agricultural data including climate, soil, and crop yields.
- **Data Augmentation**: Enhance existing datasets using machine learning models like regression, autoencoders, and GANs.
- **Demos and Use Cases**: Examples and tutorials demonstrating how to apply synthetic data for various agricultural research scenarios.

Check out our repository [here](https://github.com/SAGDAfrica/sagda) to explore the library and see demos in action.

## Get Involved  
We welcome contributors! Whether you’re a developer, researcher, or data scientist, you can contribute by forking the repo, submitting pull requests, or engaging in discussions.
